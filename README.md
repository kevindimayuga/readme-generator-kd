# Professional README Generator

This repo is for module nine's challenge assignment.


## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This project will run in the command line interface and will feature JavaScript code that I wrote. It will be invoked by using the node index.js command.

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to utilize the skills I've learned in JavaScript and Node.js. The problem it solved was to easily generate a README file so that users can devote more time working on the project itself.

## User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
```
