# Professional README Generator

This repo is for module nine's challenge assignment.


## Description

The challenge is an On-the-job ticket/feature request Challenge (begin with starter code that you need to modify). The goal is to create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This project will run in the command line interface and will feature JavaScript code that I wrote. It will be invoked by using the node index.js command.

The motivation behind this project was to learn how to utilize the skills I've learned in JavaScript and Node.js. The problem it solved was to easily generate a README file so that users can devote more time working on the project itself.
